# Sidebar Settings

Sidebar-wide options live on the top level of the `dashboard_sidebar` config, and
in the editor's **Settings** tab.

!!! tip "Two ways to edit, one switch"
    Every how-to on this site has a **Visual editor** tab and a **YAML** tab
    showing the same change two ways. Pick one and the whole site follows you,
    on every page, until you switch back.

For the complete list of every field, its type, and whether it is required, see
the [Config Reference](reference.md) (generated from the source, always current).

## Sidebar-wide options

=== "Visual editor"

    Open the editor and go to the **Settings** tab. The main options are laid out
    as fields:

    - **Position** — which edge the sidebar docks to (left or right).
    - **Width** — the expanded width in pixels. Defaults to 240 when left empty.
    - **Start Collapsed** — load collapsed to the icon strip.
    - **Hide on Mobile** — hide entirely on narrow (phone) screens.

    **Background** (any CSS background, including gradients) lives under
    **Settings → Advanced**, alongside the whole-sidebar
    [Card Mod](styling.md#card-mod).

=== "YAML"

    ```yaml
    dashboard_sidebar:
      position: right
      width: 300
      start_collapsed: false
      hide_on_mobile: true
      background: linear-gradient(180deg, #1b2735, #090a0f)
      header: []
      body: []
      footer: {}
    ```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | `left` \| `right` | `left` | Which edge the sidebar docks to. |
| `width` | number (px) | `240` | Expanded width. |
| `start_collapsed` | boolean | `false` | Load collapsed to the icon strip. |
| `hide_on_mobile` | boolean | `false` | Hide entirely on narrow (phone) screens. |
| `background` | CSS `background` | theme card bg | Any CSS background, including gradients. |
| `header` | list | — | Blocks pinned to the top. |
| `body` | list | — | Blocks in the scrolling region. |
| `footer` | mapping | — | The bottom bar (see [Footer](footer.md)). |
| `card_mod` | mapping | — | card-mod styling for the whole sidebar (see [Styling](styling.md)). |

## Collapsing

The sidebar can collapse to a slim **icon strip** using the toggle on its edge;
the choice is remembered per browser. While collapsed:

- **Titles** and **Text** blocks are hidden.
- **Items** and **categories** show as icons (or their
  [abbreviation](elements.md#item) when they have no icon); hovering shows a
  tooltip, and a category opens a popover of its items.
- **Footer buttons** collapse into a single **⋯** menu.

The editor's **Preview** has its own collapse toggle so you can check the icon
strip while building:

## Regions

- **Header** — pinned to the top, never scrolls.
- **Body** — scrolls on its own when taller than the sidebar.
- **Footer** — pinned to the bottom, never scrolls.

Each region holds an ordered list of [elements](elements.md).

=== "Visual editor"

    The **Header**, **Body**, and **Footer** tabs each edit the config key they
    are named for. Add an element with the **+** button, drag to reorder, and
    select any element to edit it.

=== "YAML"

    ```yaml
    dashboard_sidebar:
      header:
        - type: title
          text: Home
      body:
        - type: item
          title: Living Room
          tap_action: { action: navigate, navigation_path: /lovelace/living }
      footer:
        buttons:
          - icon: mdi:cog
            tap_action: { action: navigate, navigation_path: /config }
    ```
